# Async_ESP32_DC_Servo_Control
A non-blocking, asynchronous control system for DC and servo motors using the ESP32. This library ensures smooth and efficient motor operation without delays, making it ideal for robotics, automation, and real-time motion control applications. Designed on interrupt-driven and event-based handling for precise motor control in Arduino framework. ðŸš€
